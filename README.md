## Overview
In this work, we propose a robust feature extraction technique for scatter removal and density reconstruction in dynamic inertial confinement fusion (ICF) X-ray radiography. An encoder is used to extract robust features from noisy/corrupted X-ray projections and the decoder reconstructs the underlying density image from the features extracted by the encoder. We explore three options for the latent-space representation of features: physics-inspired supervision, self-supervision, and no supervision. We find that variants based on self-supervised and physics-inspired supervised features perform better over a range of unknown scatter and noise. The loss functions for these latent representation models are as follows:


1. Physics-inspired supervised latent representation (PISLR) approach:

   
\begin{equation}
    \underset{\bm{\theta}_1, \bm{\theta}_2}{\min} \,\,  \mathbb{E}_{(\bm{\rho},\,\mathbf{T})} \frac{\|D_{\bm{\theta}_2}(E_{\bm{\theta}_1}(\mathbf{T}))- \bm{\rho}\|_2}{\| \bm{\rho}\|_2} + \lambda_{\text{PISLR}} \frac{\|E_{\bm{\theta}_1}(\mathbf{T}) - \mathbf{M} \odot E_f(\bm{\rho})\|_1}{\|\mathbf{M} \odot E_f(\bm{\rho})\|_1}.   
    \label{eq:masked}
\end{equation}

2. Self-Supervised Latent Representation (SSLR) Approach:

3. Unsupervised Latent Representation (ULR) Approach:




Here, $E_{\bm{\theta}_1}$ and $D_{\bm{\theta}_2}$ are the encoder and decoder networks with parameters $\bm{\theta}_1$ and $\bm{\theta}_2$, respectively. $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{T}$ are the clean and noisy radiographs, respectively, $\bm{\rho}$ is the underlying clean density that leads to the clean radiograph. $\lambda_{\text{PISLR}}$ is the hyperparameter controlling weighting of two terms. The expectation in the loss above is with respect to the distribution of the densities and radiographs.


Here, $E_{\theta}$ and ùê∑ùúΩ2 are the encoder and decoder networks with parameters ùúΩ1 and ùúΩ2, respectively.
D and T are the clean and noisy radiographs, respectively, ùùÜ is the underlying clean density
that leads to the clean radiograph. ùúÜPISLR is the hyperparameter controlling weighting of two
terms. The expectation in the loss above is with respect to the distribution of the densities and
radiographs. ùê∏ ùëì ( ùùÜ) is the binary edgemap of the clean density above obtained after applying
a Canny edge detection filter [28] on the clean density. M is an operator that masks out the
gas-metal interface in the images retaining primarily the shock feature.

Both approaches utilize scatter-aware features extracted from the input radiographs to guide robust reconstruction under different noise conditions.

We further investigate the robustness of the proposed methods against varying levels of gamma and photon noise, as well as generalization to unseen scatter conditions.
